### b. Test if your Pegasus is ready to communicate with Astria

In the Command Prompt or Terminal, run three tests with Pegasus:

  `python test_run.py`

The word `OK` should appear three times on the Terminal/Command Prompt.
In addition, on the browser your name and login time should be displayed.

Congratulations! You are now ready for Python Coding Challenges.

### c. Test run problems
#### 1. Problem One: Find the next prime
##### The problem: *Given an positive integer, find the next prime that is equal or larger than the given number.*

The function `my_next_prime` receives a positive integer and try to check if that is a prime.

    # Verify if any odd number equal to or larger than the given number is a prime
    #
    def my_next_prime(number):
        number = int(number)
        next_prime = number if number % 2 == 1 else number + 1
        found_prime = False
        while not found_prime:
            found_prime = is_prime(next_prime)
            if found_prime:
                return next_prime
            next_prime += 2
        return next_prime

This implementation uses a helper function to determine if a number is a prime:

    # Determine if a number is a prime by looking at the remainder
    # when divided the number by all integers
    # between 2 and the number's square root
    #
    def is_prime(number):
        for i in range(2, ceil(sqrt(number)+1)):
            if number % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

An example is given for how to submit for this problem:

  # Test 3 times if my_next_prime function is correct
  #
  result = p.submit('next_prime', my_next_prime, 3)
  print('next_prime:', result)

#### 2. Problem Two: Find the fake coins
##### The problem: *There are eight identical-looking coins. One of them is a counterfeit (a fake coin) and lighter than the others. What is the minimum number of weighings needed to identify the fake coin with a two-pan balance scale and without weights? You are given a string of seven 1's and one 0. You have to simulate a weighing process to find the position of the fake coin.*

In the code, there is an example implementation:

    my_coins = '10111111'
    result = p.submit('fake_coin', my_coins, my_fake_coin(my_coins))
    print(result)

So you *know* that the second coin, or the character with index 1 in the '10111111' string, is a '0'. But of course you have to implement a function to determine this fake coin via weighing, not by looking into the string.

An incomplete implementation of `my_fake_coin` function is given:

    #
    # This is an incomplete implementation. The test run fails in most of the cases.
    #
    def my_fake_coin(coins):
        if int(coins[0]) < int(coins[1])
          return 0
        return 1

In this implementation, the first coin and the second coin are obtained by getting the first and second characters from the string, converting them to integers and comparing them. If the first coin is 0 and the second is 1, then it will return 0 as the position of the fake coin. This is the first coin, in this case, meaning the coin at index 1 is fake. Of course this implementation is incomplete and will not work in most of the cases.

*Note: The problem asks to simulate how a BALANCE SCALE works. Searching the position of the 0 digit is not the purpose of the problem. Your submission might be successful, but your code will not be accepted.*

##### The task: *Your implementation of my_fake_coin has to find the fake coin with a given random string representing the order of the coins*

Similar to the first problem, now you have to create an  implementation for `my_fake_coin` and make sure that it works with the task. Uncomment and use the following code when you think you have the right answer.

    ########################################
    # Task for the fake_coin problem: uncomment and make them work
    #
    coins = ['0', '1', '1', '1', '1', '1', '1', '1']
    shuffle(coins)
    my_coins = ''.join(coins)
    result = p.submit('fake_coin', my_coins, my_fake_coin(my_coins))
    print(result)

### Problem Three: Find the sequence of moves
#### The problem: *A knight stand on a square in the 3x3 chessboard. The squares on the board are number 1 to 9 from the top to the bottom row and from left to right. The number of the square where the knight stands is the position of the knight. Given the position, find the sequence of numbers that representing the squares the knight visit, each once, before return to the original squares.*

So this is how the board looks like:

    1 2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 9

So from 1, you can move to 6 or 8. From 6 you can move to 7, but not back to 1, and so on.

Again, a sample position is given

    ########################################
    # Sample test for the move_sequence problem
    #
    my_position ='7'
    result = p.submit('move_sequence', my_position, my_move_sequence(my_position))
    print(result)

with an fake implementation

    #
    # This is a fake implementation, it returns '16789234' or '18789234'.
    # The test run will fail.
    #
    def my_move_sequence(position):
        move_sequence = my_position
        next_position = ''
        if my_position == '1':
            next_position = choice(['6', '8'])
            move_sequence = move_sequence + next_position
            if next_position == '6':
                next_position = '7'
                move_sequence = move_sequence + next_position
        return move_sequence

*Note: The problem asks to simulate move sequences, not to show done sequences. For example to simulate a move of a knight from square 1, you have two choices: square 6, or square 8. The way your code is written is to make the knight move on a preset sequence. You have to write a code that PLAYS the moves based on the chess rules.*

##### The task: *Your implementation of my_move_sequence has to determine the sequence of move as a string of digits*

    ########################################
    # Task for the move_sequence problem: uncomment and make them work
    #
    my_position = choice(['1', '2', '3', '4', '6', '7', '8', '9'])
    result = p.submit('move_sequence', my_position, my_move_sequence(my_position))
    print(result)

## Recording of results and submissions
`Astria` records all your submissions. Every single one. She also keeps the final submission of each problem, so don't be worried if you lost the right answer in your testing. This also means she can see your guesses and brute force answers, so solve wisely.

## Evaluation of submissions
*If all final submissions are correct AND your submitted codes work accordingly, you are now admitted into the contest.*
***Congratulations!***

## C. Rules

  - Students who pass the qualification will be invited to attend the orientation o how to use `Pegasus` - the communication API to receive inputs and submit outputs to `Astria` - the evaluation server.
  - At the beginning of the semester or after each PCC contest, a new problem set of ***three (3) problems*** are ***published on the club website***. Each problem consists of a description and some example inputs. The students can start working immediately on creating Python programs to solve the given problems. They have `no access to Astria until the contestâ€™s time` and have to validate their program themselves.
  - Each contest starts at 12:00 PM Eastern Time (12:00 PM Ottawa, 9:00 AM Vancouver, 12:00 PM in Toronto, 1:00 PM Moncton, 5:00 PM UK, 6:00 France) and lasts for 90 minutes. The test supervisor(s) - Contest Organizer (CO) - decides how much additional time is allowed for students to scan and upload their work.
  - When the `contest starts`, the students will `have access to Astria`. They now can run their programs and will see Astria evaluation. They can `modify the incorrectly working programs and rerun against Astria until all correctly done`.
  - The test is carried out via Zoom under supervision of the above mentioned CO. The CO will be responsible to deliver the solutions to the personal shared folders assigned by the club to the students when the test starts. Students submit the source codes to the folder.
  - All students must follow rules when using Zoom: raise your hand when you want to talk; mute your microphone all the time except when talking; use chat if your audio not working. Paper-based books, notes, and calculators are allowed. Using computer, tablet, or mobile phone to search for any Internet source is not allowed. Help from anyone outside the team is not allowed. Violation by using external help simply results in failure of the test.
  - Grading:
    - `Correct program`: the program that provides all correct outputs for the list of given inputs will receive **maximum 7 points**.
    - Submission that is `not executable` will result in **deduction of 5 points**.
    - Total number points can be earned is 21 points.
